# BRK LDES High-5

This repo contains all code, test data and examples for the High-5 to prove (technically) Linked Data Event Stream using BRK events.

## From JSON to linked data

We use JSON-LD for this:
- W3C standard (version 1.1): https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/
- Online playground: https://json-ld.org/playground/

## From linked data to LDES Server

## From LDES Server to LDES Client

- Try out the following LDES Client:
